### Project

This is my first full stack MERN app :tada:  
It is a simple expense tracker which allows you to, well, add incomes and expenses, and remove them!  
The app will keep track of them and sum up the total of the income and expense. It will also give you the global balance.  
Everything is stored in MongoDB Atlas through the API which is based on Node & Express.  
Feel free to leave a comment.  
Tips and suggestions are more than welcome, the goal is to learn and improve :rocket:

### Features

-   Functionnal components using hooks : UseState, UseEffect, useContext & useReducer
-   Backend API with Node, Express & MongoDB
